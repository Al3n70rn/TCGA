      "#Software Overview \n",
      "\n",
      "This repository contains instructions for reproduction and extension of [Multi-tiered genomic analysis of head and neck cancer ties TP53 mutation to 3p loss]() by Gross et al. In general code for data-processing and computation is enclosed in standard python modules, while high level analyis was recorded in IPython Notebooks. The analysis for this project was relatively non-linear and has thus been split into a number of notebooks as described in [Analysis Notebooks](./Analysis_Notebooks#guide-to-running), but results should be able to be replicated by running these notebooks. \n",
      "\n",
      "__As of July 1, 2014 all error bars are off due to a [Pandas bug](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/7643). They now show the difference between the mean and the lower bound as the uncertanty for the upper and lower bound rather than show the true 95% confidence interval... hopefully this will be addressed soon.__\n",
